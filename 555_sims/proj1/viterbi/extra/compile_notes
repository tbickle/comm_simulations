.o files are "precompiled" code that doesn't change often. Thus, it can be
precompiled and already expressed in machine language (binary). A linker
pulls together all the various compiled codes and creates an executable.

To compile, simply:
g++ -c -options file.cc (or file.cpp)

To link:
g++ -o prog_name -options file1.o file2.o ... -other_libraries
