ber3_plots_feb13.jpg: 	I believe the error here is caused by my not adding Gray Coding to the modulation scheme. Per [1], "For all cases, the function assumes the use of a Gray-coded signal constellation." Thus the references I'm plotting against ARE Gray Coded. Per [2], at the bottom of the document is an example of 8-ary PSK which looks very similar to my results.
