<h1>Using g++</h1>
Most of this document was taken nearly verbatim from Paul Hilfinger.
Any errors introduced, however, are David Wolfe's.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
GNU provides are a publicly-available
optimizing compilers (translator) for C, C++, Ada 95, and Objective C that currently runs under various
implementations of Unix (plus VMS as well as OS/2 and perhaps other
PC systems) on a 
variety of processors too numerous to mention.  You can find full
documentation on-line under Emacs (use <code>C-h i</code> and select the
``GCC'' menu option).  You don't need to know much about it for our
purposes.  This document is a brief summary.

(Note that <tt>g++</tt> and <tt>gcc</tt> are, for most practical
purposes, identical programs.  Running <tt>g++</tt> is nearly the same
as <tt>gcc -lg++</tt>.  Consequently, when looking at GNU's online
documentation using Emacs info, <tt>gcc</tt> is where you'll look.)

<h2>Running the compiler</h2>
You can use <code>g++</code> both to compile programs into object modules and
to link these object modules together into a single program.  It looks
at the names of the files you give it to determine what language they
are in and what to do with them.  Files of the form <code>name.cc</code>
(or <code>name.cpp</code>) are assumed to be C++ files and files matching <code>name.o</code>
are assumed to be object (i.e., machine-language) files.

To translate a C++ source file, <code>file.cc</code>, into a corresponding
object file, <code>file.o</code>, use the <code>g++</code> command:
<pre>  g++ -c <i>compile-options</i> file.cc
</pre>
To link one or more object files, <code>file1.o</code>, <code>file2.o</code>,
..., to produced from C++ files into a 
single executable file called <code>prog</code>, use the
following command:
<pre>  g++ -o prog <i>link-options</i> file1.o file2.o ... <i>other-libraries</i>
</pre>
(The  <i>options</i> and <i>libraries</i> clauses are described below.)
<p>
You can bunch these two steps---compilation and linking---into one with the following command.
</p><pre>  g++ -o prog <i>compile-and-link-options</i> file1.cc file2.cc ... <i>other-libraries</i>
</pre>

After linking has produced an executable file called prog, it becomes,
in effect, a new Unix
command, which you can run with
<pre>  ./prog <i>arguments</i>
</pre>
where <i>arguments</i> denotes any command-line
arguments to the program.  

<h2>Libraries</h2>
A <i>library</i> is a collection of object files that has been grouped
together into a single file and indexed.  When the linking command
encounters a library in its list of object files to link, it 
looks to see if preceding object files contained calls to functions
not yet defined that are defined in one of the library's object files.
When it finds such a function, it then links in the appropriate object
file from the library.  One library gets added to the list of
libraries automatically, and provides a number of standard functions
common to C++ and C.
<p>
Libraries are usually designated with an argument of the form
<tt>-l</tt><i>library-name</i>.  In particular, <tt>-lg++</tt> denotes a
library of standard C++ routines and  <tt>-lm</tt> denotes a library
containing various mathematical routines (sine, cosine, arctan, square root, etc.)
They must be listed <i>after</i> the object or source files that
contain calls to their functions.

</p><h2>Options</h2>
The following compile- and link-options will be of particular interest
to us.
<dl>
<p></p><dt><code>-c</code> (Compilation option)
</dt><dd>	Compile only.  Produces <code>.o</code> files from source files
	without doing any linking.  

<p></p></dd><dt><code>-D</code><i>name</i>=<i>value</i> (Compilation option)
</dt><dd>	In the program being compiled, define <i>name</i> as if there
were a line
<pre>  #define <i>name</i>  <i>value</i>
</pre>
at the beginning of the program.  The `<code> = <i>value</i></code>' part
may be left off, in which case <i>value</i> defaults to 1.  

<p></p></dd><dt><code>-o</code> <i>file-name</i> (Link option, usually)
</dt><dd>
Use <i>file-name</i> as the name of the file produced by <code>g++</code>
(usually, this is an executable file). 

<p></p></dd><dt><code>-l</code><i>library-name</i> (Link option) 
</dt><dd>
Link in the specified library. See above.  (Link option).

<p></p></dd><dt><code>-g</code> (Compilation and link option) 
</dt><dd>
Put  debugging information for <code>gdb</code> into the object or executable
file.  Should be specified for 
<i>both</i> compilation and linking.

<p></p></dd><dt><code>-MM</code> (Compilation option) 
</dt><dd>
Print the header files (other than standard headers) used by each
source file in a format acceptable to <code>make</code>.
Don't produce a <code>.o</code> file or an executable.

<p></p></dd><dt><code>-pg</code> (Compilation and link option) 
</dt><dd>
Put profiling instructions for generating profiling information for
<code>gprof</code> into the object or 
executable file.  Should be specified for <i>both</i> compilation or
linking.  <i>Profiling</i> is the process of measuring how long
various portions of your program take to execute.  When you specify
<code>-pg</code>, the resulting executable program, when run, will produce a
file of statistics.  A program called <code>gprof</code> will then produce a
listing from that file telling how much time was spent executing each
function.  

<p></p></dd><dt><code>-Wall</code> (Compilation option) 
</dt><dd>
Produce warning messages about a number of things that are legal but
dubious.  I strongly suggest that you <i>always</i> specify this and
that you treat every warning as an error to be fixed.
